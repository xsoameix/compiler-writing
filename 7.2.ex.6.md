Any phrase in a sentential form can be derived from a nonterminal. If there is a nonterminal following or preceding the phrase, then there would be two consecutive nonterminals after the phrase was reduced to a nonterminal.
However, two consecutive nonterminals are not allowed in an operator grammer.
In an operator grammers no phrase in a sentential form is immediately preceded or followed by nonterminal symbols.
